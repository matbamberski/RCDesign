# BeamReinforcement
Project was made for my bachelor's degree project. 
This calculator was made for civili enginieering students, as well as for teachers, to help them understand designing reinforced concrete.
App is based on "Eurocode 2: Design of conrete strucurees EN1992-1-1". <br>

If you would like to know some details about design metodology simply send me an email! 

EDIT:
Project was developing by 2 students as a project for master thesis. The main problems was fixed and implemented. What is more, visualisations are available to display to show the correctness of designed reinforcement.
